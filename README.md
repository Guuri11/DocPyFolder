# 📚 DocPyFolder

Automate your code documentation with one single script


# 🏆 Motivation
I am tired of seeing how difficult it can be sometimes to create the documentation of a project and especially when it is very large and you don't know it at all. So out of laziness I am developing a tool that gives information that can be useful for anyone who comes to the documentation.


# 🧪 Features
- Create a diagram from folder structure
- Create a MD file from Package Json


## Run Locally

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Guuri11/DocPyFolder

```

Install dependencies

  pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Modify ROOT_DIR Constant at `./constants.py`

```bash
  ROOT_DIR = "YOUR PROJECT PATH"
```
